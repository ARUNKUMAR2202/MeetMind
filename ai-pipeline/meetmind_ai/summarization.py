Summarization stage, shared by both output branches:

- Student branch uses `segment_by_topic` (Liu et al., 2021, dynamic sliding window) to
  produce topic-organized, timestamped sections.
- Professional branch uses `aspect_based_role_summaries` (Deng et al., 2023) to split
  the transcript into decision / action-item / background / discussion sentences and
  generate a full summary for the host plus a personalized slice per participant.
